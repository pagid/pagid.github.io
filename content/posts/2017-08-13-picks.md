These are my picks of the 3d printing world for this week:

### My favorite pick this week:

{{% imgquote src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ky6XPGRTZnE/maxresdefault.jpg" alt="Stoyries X Greece - 3D Printing For A Good Cause! | " %}}
#### Stoyries X Greece - 3D Printing For A Good Cause!
The Stoyries project aims to support refugees in Greece and teamed up with Solidarity Now to deliver 3D Printed toys to refugees! All details can be found in the [crowdfunding campaign](https://www.verkami.com/projects/18170-stoyries-x-grecia). The iconic low poly plane is available thingiverse so you can [print it yourself](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ky6XPGRTZnE).

#### Dancing Springs
Vladimir uses the Circuit Playground board from Adafruit, a servo motor, and a Neopixel Ring to create a beautifully choreographed display of colors and motion. Using the sound sensor in the Circuit Playground board, his creation is able to start dancing at the sound of music. Super hypnotizing!!!

#### Adalinda: The Non Singing Serpent Voronoi
Here is Adalinda, a female dragon whose song is the most haunting of all. *Once a century, Adalinda flies to the top of the highest mountain in the realm and sings for her love who died so long ago*
This voronoi style version of Adalinda is well worth watching and listening to.
