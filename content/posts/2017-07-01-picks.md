These are my picks of the 3d printing world for this week:

{{% imgquote src="https://thingiverse-production-new.s3.amazonaws.com/renders/8e/ee/8d/b1/24/4bd433f46eda7a4e11c5e92654b72bbb_preview_featured.jpg" alt="Hollow Draudi by BCN3D" %}}
####  Hollow Draudi
The Hollow Draudi was featured by thingiverse and shows how lovely and challending 3d prints can bit. It is designed to be created on resin 3D printers mainly due to their empty geometry. In addition, all orifices, modeled with Rhinoceros and Grasshopper, give it a unique personality and a plus of difficulty that will challenge any 3D printer.

#### Marty the robot is near shipping date
Marty is a fully programmable, WiFi enabled walking robot for kids, makers, educators, and for anybody who just wants a cute robot. Marty makes learning about programming, electronics, and mechanical engineering a fun and engaging process. He is designed to be customisable with 3D printed parts, and is also completely upgradeable.

#### Baby Groot
Baby Groot is one of the most popular prints these days. It's from the blockbuster movie "Guardians of the Galaxy 2" and resembles the baby groots appearance in the trailers of the movie. Lovely and perfect when you want to get started with woodfill filament.

#### Thomas Sanladerer: This is Filaween 2.0!
Filaments need good tests: This is how Thomas will be reviewing 3D printing filaments with the Filaween 2 tests! Now including an IZOD impact strength test and a proper setup to measure rigidity or hardness of a material. Really good methodology and a remarkable of the filament market.
