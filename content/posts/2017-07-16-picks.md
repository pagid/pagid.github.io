These are my picks of the 3d printing world for this week:

Things related to desktop printing:

  - [3D Printing Nerd on the Kodama Obsidion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aGXhK8DKu4) #crowfunding another review video after some adjustments and software adjustments. Great printing results.
  - [Flexible 3D Printing Filaments Tested - Which Flex is Best?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wMKp6q9ktE)  There is LOADS of flexible 3D Printing filaments on the market today, all with different properties and features. In this video Angus from Makers Muse puts 6 different brands to the test.
  - [PacMan Magnets by CD_MT](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2389375) (by thingiverse.com )  #thing Fun prints for your whiteboards at work. They are designed to press-fit 2mm x 2mm circular magnets into the holes on the back. Very retro!

  - [You Can 3D Print Your Own Mini Universe](http://www.livescience.com/56714-3d-printed-mini-universe.html) (by Hanneke Weitering )  #thing Have you ever wondered what the universe looks like in all of its entirety, or how it would feel to hold the universe in the palm of your hand? Good news: It is now possible to do both of these things — all you need is a 3D printer.

News from the 3d printing industry:

  - [New Gyroidal Infill Geometry](http://www.fluxaxis.com/whats-cooking/new-gyroidal-infill-geometry/)  A recently developed infill structure for our 3D prints. Known as ‘gyroidal‘ infill, this complex form provides a structurally efficient, lightweight core for 3D printed objects and it looks amazing without shell!!!
  - [A shell upgrade for Seemore the sea turtle](http://www.mndaily.com/article/2017/07/a-shell-upgrade-for-seemore-the-sea-turtle) (by Sydney Baum-Haines )  #medical #prosthetics Eight years ago, Seemore the sea turtle was swimming off the coast of Florida when she was stuck by a boat, cracking her shell.  The accident left the green sea turtle with the deceptively cute named affliction, “bubble butt syndrome.
