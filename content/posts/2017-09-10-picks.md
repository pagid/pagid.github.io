#### What is “Neosanding” and Why Would You Use It?
An interesting technique used by some Ultimaker users could put a better finish on your 3D printed parts.  It’s called “Neosanding” and is a way for flat surface layers to be “polished”, so to speak.

#### Multicolor 3D Printing With a Single Extruder
Desktop FDM 3D printers have limited capabilities in terms of printing in color. The majority of such printers have a single extruder and for these, the idea of multicolor 3D printing has been a challenge for a long time.
