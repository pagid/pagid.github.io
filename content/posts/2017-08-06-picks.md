#### Building a Safe Cracking Robot
Nate's wife gave him a cheap fire safe she purchased off of Craigslist. It was super cheap because the seller didn’t have the combination. Now we all have to thank her for the fun project she gave Nate and which Nate shared with us.

#### Randomly generating 3D mazes
One thing Conor wanted to make with his 3d-printer was a puzzle that took advantage of the strengths of 3D printing. He had no luck on Thingiverse, so he decided to write a program to randomly generate 3D mazes.

There may be a pretender in your next box of fruit, a fake fruit that tracks temperatures, motion, and shocks to ensure your plums are sweet and hard and your peaches are pretty as can be.

#### Nvidia aims to tackle complex 3D printing with GPU power
As 3D printing charges towards its goal of complex multi-material, coloured, differing density prints, some limitations kick in - namely automation of designs for best possible prints.
